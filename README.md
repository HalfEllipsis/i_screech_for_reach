# i_screech_for_reach

The current code is modelled after https://github.com/ericterpstra/anagrammatix. It uses [Socket.IO] (http://socket.io/) to manage client/server communications and to create the server, and [Phaser] (phaser.io) to handle the GUI elements. [node.js] (https://nodejs.org/) is required in order to start the server. At the top level of this repo, run `node index.js` to start the server. You can then connect to the game by going to `localhost:8080` in your web brower.

## IDE

An eclipse project is set up, so you can get set up in [eclipse] (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-javascript-web-developers/heliosr). Download from the [link] (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-javascript-web-developers/heliosr), and then import the project by Right-clicking in the "Project Explorer", selecting "Import", selecting "Import from Existing Project", and go from there.
